1. Install the serverless tool on your development machine:

```
npm install -g serverless
```

2. Configure your serverless environment by logging in to your AWS account:

```
serverless config credentials --provider aws --key <access key> --secret <secret key>
```

The access key and secret key are the same access key and secret key that was used in the previous Elastic Beanstalk tutorial.
